## Features
- Responsive design built with pure HTML and CSS.
- Recreated header, navigation bar, content sections, and footer.
- Utilizes modern CSS techniques (Flexbox/Grid) for layout.
- Lightweight and fast-loading static site.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Structure and semantic markup.
- **CSS3:** Styling, layout, and responsive design.

## Setup & Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```
2. **View Locally:**
   - Open `index.html` in your browser to see the site.

## Development Notes

  The design is inspired by kiit.ac.in with attention to recreating the layout and design elements.
- **Techniques Used:**  
  Employed CSS Flexbox/Grid for layout, media queries for responsiveness, and semantic HTML for accessibility.
